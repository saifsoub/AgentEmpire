# Meridian / AgentEmpire runtime contract

Status: recovered execution contract for DONEAI-126 / DONEAI-47.

Canonical engineering worker: **Codex — `S-PASS-20260911-002`**. Filesystem paths, branch names, build directories, containers and `/root/...` paths are execution locations only; they are never passport identities.

## Source identity

The historical Meridian engineering work in Linear referred to the same Next.js operator-cockpit source family as **AgentEmpire**. The currently connected canonical repository is:

- Repository: `saifsoub/AgentEmpire`
- Baseline branch: `main`
- Recovery baseline: `5f8edea6563b03b3a1af43b53d3695f9a028fb89`
- Runtime: Next.js App Router + React on Node.js

Historical Codex commits referenced in Linear (`39eb715`, `96e8cca`) are not present in the connected GitHub repository, so their runtime/package contract is being reconstructed transparently on a new review branch rather than represented as already published code.

## Canonical production profile

Meridian is the private S/ control-room UI. The canonical production profile is a hardened Linux **Node profile** (rootless container or systemd-managed Node process) behind the private S/ service fabric.

The control boundary is:

`Meridian UI → S/ Control API → authorization / approval / effect engine → runtime adapter → verification → event ledger`

The read boundary is:

`Meridian UI → S/ Control API → normalized read models`

The UI must not call cloud, network, GitHub, payment, database-admin or other infrastructure-provider administration APIs directly from browser code.

For this baseline, the following are explicitly **not** canonical deployment targets:

- Cloudflare Pages;
- a Worker-backed browser executor;
- Vite static hosting.

Cloudflare may be introduced later only through a separately bounded adapter or public-surface decision.

## Node and package-manager contract

The repository declares:

- Node: `>=22 <23`
- npm: `>=10 <11`

Use the committed lockfile and a clean reproducible install:

```bash
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
```

Equivalent repository helper:

```bash
npm run install:local
```

## Local boot

```bash
npm run boot:local
```

This starts the existing Next.js dev server on port `7483`.

Direct equivalent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Verification contract

Before a release candidate can be treated as runtime-ready, run:

```bash
npm run deploy:verify
```

That command executes, in order:

1. TypeScript typecheck;
2. Vitest test suite;
3. Next.js production build.

Production boot remains:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

A release candidate is not accepted solely because the build command exits successfully. It must also prove the user and control boundaries expected by the locked Meridian contract: navigation, issue/board rendering, create/update flows, command palette, safe AI fallback, absence of direct browser-side infrastructure administration, server health, telemetry/release identity, and approval/verification behavior for mutating control commands.

## Environment and secret boundary

Repository provider credentials and connector tokens are **server-only by default**. In particular, values such as Anthropic, Groq, Composio, webhook and MCP tokens must never be exposed in client bundles.

Only variables intentionally designed as browser-safe configuration may use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. A provider secret must never be renamed with that prefix merely to make browser code work.

The production Meridian control path must expose an explicit S/ Control API base URL and authenticated server-side boundary. Provider unavailability must produce a deterministic degraded/fallback state rather than optimistic success.

## Private exposure

The intended owner/operator surface is private. Tailscale service identity or the approved S/ private service fabric may publish the Node service to authorized operators. Public Funnel/admin exposure is not part of this baseline.

## Deployment boundary for this recovery branch

This recovery branch only restores a reproducible runtime/package contract and validation path. It does **not** authorize:

- production deployment;
- secret binding;
- DNS changes;
- Tailscale policy changes;
- public exposure;
- direct provider administration from the browser;
- bypassing S/ approval policy.

Those remain separately controlled actions.
